# WorkHours
The modified program simulates and calculates the work hours logged by employees each day. It computes the total and average work hours, which serves several business needs and brings multiple benefits.

**Work Hours Logging and Management:**

Simulation and Analysis: It simulates work hours for a different number of employees over various days. This is useful for managing and predicting employee work hours.
Data Validation and Testing: It can be used to test employee work hour logging systems to verify their performance and reliability under different workloads.
Data Aggregation and Reporting:

Total Work Hours Calculation: It calculates the total work hours, which is essential for project management and HR purposes.
Average Work Hours Analysis: It computes the average work hours to help management understand the average workload of employees and identify overload or inefficiency issues.


**Efficient Simulation Tool:**

Quick Simulation: It can quickly generate simulated data for analysis and decision support.
Flexibility: It can be adjusted for different numbers of employees and days, adapting to various business needs.

**Data Analysis and Visualization:**
Data Display: It presents data in a matrix format, making work hours data clear and easy to understand, which helps in identifying patterns and anomalies.
Statistical Summary: It provides a summary of total and average work hours, enabling management to make data-driven decisions.

**Employee Performance Management:**
Performance Evaluation: By analyzing work hours data, it helps evaluate employee performance and work efficiency.
Resource Allocation Optimization: Understanding employee workloads helps in allocating resources appropriately, avoiding waste or shortage of human resources.
